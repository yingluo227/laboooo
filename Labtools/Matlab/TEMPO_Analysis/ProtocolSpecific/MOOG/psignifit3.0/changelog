2011-08-27

* Fixed bug in sensitivity analysis

2011-08-18

* Refactoring optimizer to be more robust
* fixing segfaults in ASIR inference
* fixing most unit tests
* updates in documentation
* removed psipy

2011-07-04

* Various documentation changes
* ASIR inference uses finer grid, moment matching and avoids numerical
  integration in 3/4d.
* Bugfix: Speed issues in psignifit-bootstrap -- jackknife used to call
  getstart unnessessarily often.

2011-06-07

* Updating documentation
* bugfix: no status messages any more to make matlab interface working
* posterior oversampling factor for ASIRInference can be specified from python

2011-05-17

* New strategy for Bayesian inference: Numerical integration of posterior,
  fitting marginal distributions and sampling importance resampling in python
  object ASIRInference
* plotJoint distribution
* various bugfixes

2011-05-05

* Updated documentation
* changed distribution targets
* a number of small bugfixes
* improvements of matlab interface

2011-03-24

* Bugfix: command line interface checks ALL output for NaN
* A couple of typos and documentations updates

2011-03-11

* Bugfix: cut can be a float
* Swig function to get the points of a grid

2011-02-02

* A couple of bugfixes mainly with the matlab interface

2010-12-21

* New: version numbers in psignifit can be displayed in scripts
  e.g. pypsignifit.version
* Bugfix: stimulus intensities for bootstrap are always double
* Bugfix: switched off tunesampler in MCMC -> used to give weired behavior
  we now got back to Laplace approximations

2010-12-16

* Mersenne Twister is faster for MCMC

2010-12-15

* Improving grid search to also work with very narrow priors
* Using results from grid search to set initial simplex size
* Optimized MCMC --- reduced data sets are created only once

2010-12-10

* Zoom-in grid search for robust starting value determination

2010-12-08

* Bugfixes: Slope handling was wrong due to an error in documentation
* Bugfixes:  documentation is fixed and slope handling, too.

2010-12-06

* Added BCa confidence intervals for slope to the high level interface
* Checking command line arguments based on docstring

2010-11-29

* Bugfix: cuts is checked to be iterable in constructor
* Bugfix: if ConvergenceMCMC has less then three chains, Rhat is not printed
* Bugfix: axes limits are set to lists to be mutable
* Makefile flexibility increased

2010-11-12

* Bugfixes: In coverage.py script and in PsiPsychometric::getStart

2010-10-27

* Bugfix in matlab interface: nafc is actually used
* bugfix in coverage script: default values
* matlab interface has default priors

2010-10-21

* Old matplotlib versions require fake iterables for plotting

2010-10-21

* Fixed warnings for the dependency on matplotlib to be suppressable

2010-10-21

* Allowing older versions of matplotlib (spines are not required)
* added some examples for the python interface

2010-10-18

2010-10-13

* Fixed bug with tmp-files to (mainly a windows issue)

2010-09-17

2010-09-03

* enables gamma==lambda constraints from high level python interface

2010-07-16

* Activates new interface layer swignifit
* Fixes a number of memory leaks
* Overhall of build system
* Makes available Beta-regression for psychometric functions (so far only via
  swig/C++)
