- change transform method of cores to new getstart
- noninformative Jeffreys Priors
- Goodness of fit (Correlations?)                                          [OK] but correlations are wrong
- Unit test with gamma as a free parameter                                 [OK] but only very rough correspondence to psignifit -- should be stricter
- Bugs with different cores -> no convergence, exceptionally high deviance with ok looking fit, ... This is only due to the logCore-Kernel that returns -inf for contrasts of 0
- codes in sigmoids should be constants with ' const unsigned int $VARIBALE'
- add 'void' to the clone method calls
- In PsiMCList, getdeviance and setdeviance should be getDeviance and
  setDeviance
- Review the documentation for BootstrapList
- in PsiSigmoid getcode() should be getCode()
- Use pure virtual functions in PsiSigmoid, PsiCore, and PsiPrior, instead of
  NotImplemetedError
- Make proper copy constructors for rng.h instead of relying on implicit ones

- When using [] to access elements from the vector class, we need to manually
  check that the index value is within range. Alternatively we could use the
  'at()' method, which is index safe, and throws an 'std::out_of_range'
  exception. Consider replacing parts of the code that do th manual checking
  with calls to 'at()'. In this case we would also benefit from the swig
  exception handling for all STL exceptions.

MayBe:
- implement fullmodel, nullmodel
- Implement alternative SimplexAlgorithm (Numerical Recipes?, gsl-Wrapper-Object?) The current one depends heavily on the initial simplex!
    - Perform some gradient based steps after simplex optimization (doesn't work good)
    - alternative: Perform some gradient based steps as a special case of simplex optimization (e.g. particularly good points are moved in the direction of the gradient?)
